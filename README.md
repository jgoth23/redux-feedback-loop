# Project Name
Feedback loop

## Description

In this project I mimicked the everyday feedback forum we would submit after class. Each view allows an input scaling from 0 to 5 based upon how the day went and a spot for leaving a comment about the day. At the end on the loop there is a final review of all the inputs before committing the final feedback. 

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
